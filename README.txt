PSCRYPTER v2.0

This is a port of the PRX signer posted in here http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1381

The author of the signing code is "bbtgp" but with the help of many great coders in that forum.
v2.0 fixes realocations with the code by JJS and supports 4MB eboots

The port has been made by Carlosgs.

USAGE
Place the "EBOOT.PBP" you want to sign in the folder "sign" and run PSCRYPTER from the PSP.
It should take a minute to complete the process, and after it is successful, the file "EBOOT_signed.PBP" will apear
inside the "sign" folder.
That EBOOT should run on any PSP with OFW installed (CFW too of course).

DISCLAIMER
Carlosgs and "bbtgp" dont take ANY RESPONSABILITY of the result of using this code or executables.
